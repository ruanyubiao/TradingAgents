"""Sentiment analyst — multi-source sentiment analysis for a target ticker.

Previously named ``social_media_analyst``. Renamed and redesigned because
the old version had a prompt that demanded social-media analysis but the
only tool available was Yahoo Finance news — which led LLMs to fabricate
Reddit/X/StockTwits content under prompt pressure (verified live).

The redesigned agent pre-fetches three complementary data sources before
the LLM is invoked and injects them into the prompt as structured blocks:

  1. News headlines     — Yahoo Finance (institutional framing)
  2. StockTwits messages — retail-trader posts indexed by cashtag, with
                           user-labeled Bullish/Bearish sentiment tags
  3. Reddit posts        — r/wallstreetbets, r/stocks, r/investing

The agent does not use tool-calling; the data is in the prompt from
turn 0. The LLM produces the sentiment report in a single invocation.

2. **Look for cross-source divergences.** If news framing is bearish but Guba posts are talking about "抄底" (buying the dip) or "底部" (bottom), that mismatch is itself a signal.

3. **Distinguish opinion from event.** A news headline is an event; a Guba post title is opinion. Both are inputs but should be weighted differently.

4. **Identify recurring narrative themes.** What topic keeps coming up across sources? That's the dominant narrative driving current sentiment.

5. **Be honest about data limits.** If Guba returned limited data or one or more sources returned an error placeholder, flag this caveat explicitly.

6. **Identify catalysts and risks** that emerge across sources — earnings, product launches, policy changes, macro headlines, etc.

7. **Past sentiment is not predictive.** Frame your conclusions as signal for the trader to weigh alongside fundamentals and technicals, not as a price call."""

1. **Read the StockTwits Bullish/Bearish ratio as a leading retail-sentiment signal.** A 70/30 bullish/bearish split is moderately bullish; ≥90/10 may indicate over-extension and contrarian risk; 50/50 is uncertainty. Sample size matters — base rates on the actual message count, not percentages alone.

2. **Look for cross-source divergences.** If news framing is bearish but StockTwits is overwhelmingly bullish, that mismatch is itself a signal — it can mean retail is leaning into a thesis the news flow hasn't caught up to (or vice versa, that retail is chasing while institutions are cautious).

3. **Weight Reddit posts by engagement.** A 400-upvote / 200-comment thread reflects community attention; a 3-upvote post is noise. Read the body excerpts for context — the title alone often misleads.

4. **Distinguish opinion from event.** A news headline ("Nvidia announces $500M Corning deal") is an event; a StockTwits post ("buying NVDA, this is going to moon") is opinion. Both are inputs but should be weighted differently in your conclusions.

5. **Identify recurring narrative themes.** What topic keeps coming up across sources? That's the dominant narrative driving current sentiment.

6. **Be honest about data limits.** If StockTwits returned only a handful of messages, or one or more sources returned an "<unavailable>" placeholder, the sentiment read is less robust — flag this caveat explicitly. If the sources are silent on a given subreddit, say so.

7. **Identify catalysts and risks** that emerge across sources — news of upcoming earnings, product launches, competitive threats, macro headlines, etc.
